Ingredients.
  * 2 cups flour
  * 1 teaspoon baking powder
  * 1 teaspoon baking soda
  * 1/2 teaspoon salt
  * 1/2 cup butter
  * 1/2 cup white sugar
  * 1/2 cup brown sugar
  * 1/2 cup cocoa powder
  * 2 eggs
  * 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  * 1 cup caramel sauce
  * Sea salt, to taste

Instructions.

Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

Melt the butter in a saucepan over low heat.

Add the white and brown sugar to the saucepan, and stir until well combined.

Remove the saucepan from heat, and stir in the cocoa powder until smooth.

Beat in the eggs, one at a time, and stir in the vanilla extract.

Gradually add the sifted dry ingredients to the mixture in the saucepan, stirring until just combined.

Drop spoonfuls of the batter onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the edges are set.

Remove from the oven, and allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes.

Drizzle caramel sauce over each cookie, and sprinkle with sea salt to taste.

Serve and enjoy!
